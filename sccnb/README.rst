=============

A note about version number. The major number denotes
which version of SableCC is compatible. 
Version 1 is for SableCC 3.x. The first minor number
denotes the version of the plug-in. The plug-in is in beta,
so it hat version number 0. The second one is the minor
number of version. I increment it if the plug-in has some new features.
