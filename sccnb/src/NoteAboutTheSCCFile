== Note about The three SCC Files ==
 * The file sablecc-3x-org.scc is the original file in sablecc project
 * In the file sableccLexer-3x.scc the Ingnored Tokens section is removed,
   so all tokens are recognized and colored.
 * In the file sableccParser3xNoAbstract.scc the Abstract Syntax Tree section 
   is removed, so all Production is recognized  in the AST.
